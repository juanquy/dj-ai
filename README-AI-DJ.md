# Advanced AI DJ Features for DJAI

DJAI now includes advanced AI-powered DJ mixing features that go beyond simple crossfades. The new system implements real DJ techniques like beatmatching, harmonic mixing, and intelligent track ordering.

## New Features

### Server-Side Audio Analysis

- **Advanced BPM Detection**: More accurate tempo analysis using multiple detection algorithms
- **Beat Tracking**: Identifies individual beat positions for precise transitions
- **Key Detection**: Analyzes the musical key of each track for harmonic mixing
- **Energy Analysis**: Measures energy levels throughout the track for better set pacing
- **Intelligent Transition Points**: Finds ideal transition points at musical phrase boundaries

### Advanced Track Ordering Algorithms

- **BPM Progression**: Creates smooth tempo changes through your set
- **Harmonic Mixing**: Orders tracks to follow the Camelot wheel (circle of fifths) for smooth key transitions
- **Energy Curve**: Builds energy up and then down for a professional DJ flow
- **Weighted Multi-Factor Algorithm**: Combines multiple strategies for optimal track order

### Real Beatmatching and Mixing

- **Tempo Synchronization**: Automatically adjusts playback speed to match BPMs
- **Multiple Transition Types**:
  - **Beatmatch Blend**: Full synchronization for seamless transitions
  - **Harmonic Fade**: EQ-based transitions for tracks in compatible keys
  - **Tempo Adjust**: Gradual tempo changes for tracks with different BPMs
  - **Cut with EQ**: DJ-style cut transitions with EQ adjustments
  - **Long Fade**: Extended transitions for more challenging track pairs

### DJ Controls

- **3-Band EQ**: Low, Mid, and High frequency controls
- **Tempo Adjustment**: Manual tempo control
- **Auto-Beatmatch Toggle**: Enable/disable automatic beatmatching
- **Advanced Visualizer**: Real-time frequency visualization

## Technical Implementation

DJAI uses several advanced audio processing libraries:

1. **Essentia.js**: Audio analysis library for BPM detection, key extraction, and beat tracking
2. **Meyda**: JavaScript audio feature extraction for real-time analysis
3. **SoundTouch.js**: Audio processing library for high-quality time stretching and pitch shifting
4. **Web Audio API**: Core browser API for real-time audio manipulation

## How to Use

1. **Upload your tracks**: Local uploads get the most detailed analysis
2. **Generate a mix**: The AI will analyze and arrange tracks optimally
3. **Play your mix**: The enhanced player will perform real DJ-style transitions
4. **Adjust the controls**: Fine-tune the EQ and tempo settings
5. **Toggle beatmatching**: Enable/disable automatic beatmatching

## AI-Powered Lyrics and Visualizations

DJAI now includes advanced AI features for lyrics detection and visualization:

- **Direct Lyrics Detection**: Uses AI speech recognition to extract lyrics from audio
- **Synchronized Lyrics Display**: Perfectly timed lyrics overlay on visualizations
- **LTX Prompt Generation**: Creates tailored prompts for each lyric segment
- **Emotional Content Analysis**: Analyzes lyrics for emotional tone to match visuals
- **Adaptive Video Generation**: Pre-generates video segments based on lyrics content
- **Custom Video Prompts**: Users can input their own creative prompts for visuals
- **High-Quality Video Generation**: Uses Lightricks/LTX-Video model for superior visuals

## Future Plans

- Beat-accurate looping for extended transitions
- Real-time BPM detection for even more accurate beatmatching
- Machine learning to improve transitions based on user feedback
- Advanced audio effects (echo, delay, reverb) for creative mixing
- Stem separation for instrumental/vocal isolation during transitions
- Multiple language support for lyrics detection
- Fine-tunable AI models for custom music genres
